## 🚀 Overview

This project is designed to help learners demystify abstract data structure concepts through intuitive visualizations. Whether you're a student or an aspiring developer, this tool provides a hands-on approach to understanding structures like stacks, queues, and trees.

---

## 🧩 Features

- **🔁 Five Core Data Structures**
  - Arrays
  - Stacks (LIFO)
  - Queues (FIFO)
  - Linked Lists
  - Binary Search Trees (BST)

- **🛠 Interactive Controls**
  - Perform operations like:
    - `push()` / `pop()` for Stacks
    - `enqueue()` / `dequeue()` for Queues
    - `append()` for Linked Lists
    - `insert()` for BSTs

- **⚡ Real-Time Visualization**
  - Instant DOM updates after every operation for immediate feedback.

- **🔄 Dynamic UI**
  - UI adapts based on the selected data structure and its associated operations.

- **🧠 Pure JavaScript Logic**
  - All data structures implemented from scratch using ES6+ classes and object-oriented principles.

- **🌙 Modern & Responsive UI**
  - Sleek dark-mode theme.
  - Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
